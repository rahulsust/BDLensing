For frequentists, probability only has meaning in terms of a limiting case of repeated measurements. That is, if I measure the photon flux F
 from a given star (we'll assume for now that the star's flux does not vary with time), then measure it again, then again, and so on, each time I will get a slightly different answer due to the statistical error of my measuring device. In the limit of a large number of measurements, the frequency of any given value indicates the probability of measuring that value. 
 
 For Bayesians, probabilities are fundamentally related to our own knowledge about an event. This means, for example, that in a Bayesian view, we can meaningfully talk about the probability that the true flux of a star lies in a given range. That probability codifies our knowledge of the value based on prior information and/or available data.
 
  We'll make the reasonable assumption that errors are Gaussian. In a Frequentist perspective, $e_{i} $
 is the standard deviation of the results of a single measurement event in the limit of repetitions of *that event*. In the Bayesian perspective,  $e_{i} $
 is the standard deviation of the (Gaussian) probability distribution describing our knowledge of that particular measurement given its observed value)
 
 MCMC = Markov Chain Monte Carlo,is a sampler, allow you to estimate (sample) the posterior distribution.
